# Resin Printing Stuff
GCODE and other stuff for resin printing.

* [Mix 50x.gcode](Mix%2050x.gcode): Home the build plate, raise 1mm, then go up and down 10mm repeatedly 50 times to mix a resin vat that has been left unemptied for a while.


Resin Printing Tips
* Avoid using any tools to remove failed prints from the FEP film. Instead, you should use the tip of your finger (not your nail!) to gently press on the failed print from underneath the FEP. This should release the print from the FEP, allowing you to either remove it by hand, or if required, very gently lift the failure with a plastic spatula. Always be careful when using tools like spatulas around the resin vat as the FEP is easy to puncture.
* When possible, avoid printing flat surfaces in parallel to the build plate. Large flat surfaces create large amounts of suction when the build plate rises, increasing the risk that the force required to remove the print from the FEP will exceed the force of the print's adhesion to the build plate. If possible, print at a 45 degree angle (when your X/Y resolution matches your Z resolution. This will greatly reduce the relative force exerted on the build plat adhesion.
* If printing directly on the build plate with a wide, flat surface, you may need to significantly slow down the bottom lift speed to give the resin a chance to flow in-between the FEP and the surface being peeled away. Otherwise you can have failed prints or "layer shifts" from the build plate or platform shifting from the force of the suction.
* Have two wash containers of isopropyl or denatured alcohol. The first container should be your dirty wash, and the second your final rinse. This helps insure your prints come out as clean as possible before curing without diluted resin residue on the print surface.
